# MC-267125
This mod is a single mixin mod that fixes a bug where command suggestions on the client do not get updated for any reloadable content upon /reload.

https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267125

## Forge/NeoForge?
This bug is already fixed by the loader, so this mod would be obsolete there.

## Backport?
Try using a dependency override for your version, if it doesn't work, rip.
If it does, please tell me and I'll update the mod's FMJ, I just didn't have the time to check every old MC version.

A guide on how to use a dependency override can be found here:
